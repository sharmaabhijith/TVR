# Total Variation based image Resurfacing (TVR)

Adversarial patches threaten visual AI models in the real world. The number of patches in a patch attack is variable and determines the attackâ€™s potency in a specific environment. Most existing defenses assume a single patch in the scene, and the multiple-patch scenario is shown to overcome them. This work presents a model-agnostic defense against patch attacks based on total variation for image resurfacing (TVR). The TVR is an image-cleansing method that processes images to remove probable adversarial regions. TVR nullifies the influence of patches in a single image scan with no prior assumption on the number of patches in the scene.
